Hello,  I'm Akshath Raghav ðŸ‘‹
---

I'm an undergraduate student @ Purdue University, pursuing a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering. I intend to graduate with through the AI/ML concentration within the ECE Department

My primary interest revolves arould building robust user-facing solutions at the intersection of applied AI, reproducible (open-source) softwares and interoperablility principles. I enjoy research-driven environments aimed at taking concepts to tangible products.

I'm currently looking to get involved in 3D Reconstruction, Multi-robot interactions and MLOps at scale. I'd highly appreciate any mentorship or suggestions for research labs @ Purdue that focus on these topics!
