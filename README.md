Hello,  I'm Akshath Raghav ðŸ‘‹
---

I'm an BS/MS student @ Purdue University, pursuing a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering. 

My primary interest revolves arould building robust user-facing solutions at the intersection of explainable learning algorithms and interoperable systems. I enjoy research-driven environments aimed at taking concepts to tangible products.

Automatability, reproducibility and accessability remain the core of my work.

Iâ€™m concurrently working on multimodal document understanding, model-task alignment and integrated tools for AI agents. Post this, I intend to dive into accelerated computing and parallized ML architectures. Feel free to reach out to me at araviki[at]purdue[dot]edu.
